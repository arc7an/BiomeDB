;; @description The heart of Dragonfly - A newLISP web framework for rapid web development.
;; @version 0.70
;; @author Team Dragonfly 2009
;; @location http://code.google.com/p/dragonfly-newlisp/
;; <br>This file is the main entry-point of the Dragonfly framework and
;; contains several important functions, as well as the default route
;; definitions. The functions here are in the 'Dragonfly' context (alias 'DF'),
;; which is the context your static files will be evaluated in by default.
;; Therefore all of the functions here can be called in your templates without
;; needing to be context-qualified.
;; <br><br>Dragonfly's design is very simple, you can actually read through its
;; source in very little time to get a great understanding of exactly how
;; it works, and to get an idea of what sorts of tricks you can do to
;; customize it to your liking (remember, newLISP is <extremely> dynamic!).
;; <h3>The 'listener' function</h3>
;; The 'listener' function is called in 'index.cgi'. It is the function that
;; kicks everything off by looping through the available routes, finding a
;; match, running it, sending the output to the browser, and then exiting.
;; <br><br>Before all of that, the very *first* thing it does is load the
;; plugins in the 'dragonfly-framework/plugins-active' folder, giving them
;; an opportunity to do any special customization that they might require.
;; <h3>Environment Variables</h3>
;; At the very top of the 'config.lsp' file there is the following line:
;; <pre> (dolist (x (env)) (constant (global (sym (upper-case (first x)))) (last x)))</pre>
;; This line simply loops through every environment variable and makes a
;; global symbol out of it. This makes it extremely simple to access environment
;; variables, simply type their name! If you prefer PHP-style, you can
;; access them through the '$SERVER' function (simply a synonym for 'env').
;; <br><br>To access any web parameters, files, and cookies use the functions '$GET', '$POST',
;; '$FILES', and '$COOKIES', respectively. See 'Request.lsp' for more information.
;; <h3>Routes</h3>
;; <p>Routes are FOOP objects inheriting from the Route class. They should have the 'Route.' prefix.
;; Currently they only need to support two functions: 'matches?' and 'run'.</p>
;; <p>The listener loops through the available routes and calls 'matches?' on them
;; with no arguments. The route must decide, based on any data available to it,
;; whether or not it to return a non-nil value from 'matches?'.</p>
;; Here, for example, is the 'matches?' function for 'Route.Resource':
;; <pre> (define (matches?)
;;     (when (regex {^([a-z]\w+)(/([a-z]\w+))?(/(\d+))?(\.([a-z]+))?} QUERY_STRING 1)
;;         (set 'resource_name $1 'resource_action $3 'resource_id $5 'response_format $7)
;;         (file? (set 'path (DF:resource-path resource_name)))
;;     )
;; )
;; </pre>
;; There are two default routes: 'Route.Static' and 'Route.Resource'. See the
;; documentation on the example-site and in 'config.lsp' for more information on
;; what they do.
;; <h3>Resources</h3>
;; 'Route.Resource' handles URLs that refer to RESTful resources, represented as FOOP objects
;; deriving from the 'Resource' class. The resources reside in the 'RESOURCES_PATH' as .lsp files.
;; The URL scheme works in a similar manner to twitter's RESTful API:
;; <pre>http://mysite.com/<resource>[/<action>][/<id>][.<response_format>][?get paramters...]</pre>
;; 'resource' maps to a context name in a special way. First 'Resource.' is prepended
;; to the name, then the underscores are removed and the name is written in title case.
;; The 'resource' may only have the letters A-Z (lowercase or uppercase), 0-9, the underscore,
;; and it must begin with a letter.
;; <br/><pre> my_resource => Resource.MyResource</pre>
;; The name also maps to a real file located in 'RESOURCES_PATH' by appending ".lsp" to the name:
;; <br/><pre> my_resource => load file: RESOURCES_PATH/my_resource.lsp</pre>
;; If 'resource' implements 'action', then that function is called.
;; Like 'resource', 'action' may only contain letters, numbers, and the underscore.
;; If no 'action' is specified, then the resource's default function is called instead.
;; If it is specified but no method of that name is found, 'catch-all' will be called, which
;; by default calls 'Dragonfly:die'. You can override 'catch-all' and do dispatch within
;; it, as it takes the action name (as a string) as the first argument, followed by the
;; 'id' and the 'response_format'.
;; <p>The optional paramters 'id' and 'response_format' are passed in to the function
;; as parameters (in that order, unless it is the 'catch-all' function, in which case
;; 3 parameters are passed in as described above).</p>
;; <p>'id' may only contain numbers, and 'response_format' may only contain letters.</p>
;; <h3>Plugins</h3>
;; There are two types of plugins, those in the 'plugins-active' folder, and those
;; in the 'plugins-inactive' folder. The ones in the former are loaded when 'listener'
;; is called, prior to running the routes. Every .lsp file in the 'plugins-active' folder
;; is loaded at that point, so you'll only want your most frequently used files in there.
;; <p>A good example of an active plugin is a custom route. Defining a custom route consists
;; of two basic steps: creating your 'Route' "subclass", and adding an instance of
;; it to 'Dragonfly:dragonfly-routes'. Take a look at how it's done in the source of
;; 'dragonfly.lsp' for more info.</p>
;; <p>Inactive plugins are simply those that should be loaded on a "need to use" basis.
;; Most plugins will probably fall into this category. Use 'Dragonfly:activate-plugin'
;; to load them. All plugins are loaded exactly once, no matter how many times
;; 'activate-plugin' is called on them.</p>
